## Random Color Picker
In this project, I’ll build a program that helps designers think of new color schemes.

Our program will set the screen’s background to a random color. Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color. Random generators are a well-known tool for breaking a creative rut.

Random Color Picker is hosted on Netlify [Random Color Picker](https://random-color-picker.netlify.app/)
